I did an UI/UX project for the maharashtra government's Guest House booking app.

- I learnt through this project how many intricate details are there in a fully function apps.
- It had several components like document verification, review system, editing of personal information, summary of the booking, room selection, etc.
- This UI was very comprehensive and you can see all the componenets in the screenshots provided.
